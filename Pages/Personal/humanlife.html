                    <p><strong>Human Life</strong></p>
                    <p>Inside Milky way galaxy, we know that we have many planets. Built from Rocks and Gases.</p>
                    <p>As far as we know “Earth” is the only planet which sustains life because of Water and oxygen.</p>
                    <p>So sometimes I imagine we are constantly traveling with space sitting inside a giant round thing ( Earth) which is built of Rocks, Water, Gases, Human & animal lives.</p>
                    <p>Humans/Animals are guests on this planet for a specific period and everyone dies in the end.</p>
                    <p>When any human gets birth they are automatically being tagged to their parents, Religion, Color, Country, borders, and politics.</p>
                    <p>One born in a Developed country and one born in a poor country both get used to a different environment and struggle through their life until the end. I think most struggle happens with people from poor countries.</p>
                    <p>In poor countries, people fight for food, Religion, Quality of life, political stability, and the same time people from developed countries find a good job, visit many different places,  spent time with their loved once and stay away from mental stress.</p>
                    <p>God gave us earth and humans divided earth area into many different parts. </p>
                    <p>If you recall the time when humans were at their very early stage of settlement, They fight combined to survive,  they cared for each other and they just took what was necessary for their life without being racist about color, Ethnicity, and their belongingness. Sorry, these concepts did not exist at that time.</p>
                    <p><strong>But Remember</strong></p>
                    <p>Nature is the ultimate answer to all unequal activities. You claim your land, your passport, and your possession but once humanity crosses its limits anywhere on this planet nature will take revenge from us equally. Because humanity was designed to be equal and to survive equally.</p>
                    <p>We are nowhere serious about climate change, so just imagine there is water everywhere because of very heavy rain. Everything is drowning into water. Even you can not guess where you are at the moment.</p>
                    <p><strong>Then</strong></p>
                    <p>How would you claim for your land and your possession?  You will need help from another human to survive and to start life all over again. So you know its cycle of life.</p>
                    <p>Stay away for negativity and make yourself happy from whatever you have. </p>
                    <p>The clock never stops but you would.</p>
                    <p>Be kind and help each other. </p>
